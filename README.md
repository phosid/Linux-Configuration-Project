# Linux-Configuration-Project
##Project Description
This is the final project for Udacity Full Stack Web Development program. In this project, I take a baseline installation of a Linux server and prepare it to host web applications. I also secure the server from a number of attack vectors, install and configure a database server, and deploy one of my existing web applications onto it.
