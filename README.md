# Linux-Configuration-Project
## Project Description
This is the final project for Udacity Full Stack Web Development program. In this project, I take a baseline installation of a Linux server and prepare it to host web applications. I also secure the server from a number of attack vectors, install and configure a database server, and deploy one of my existing web applications onto it.

- IP-Address: 54.189.211.121
- Accessible SSH port: 2200
- URL: http://54.189.211.121.xip.io/

## Steps Taken:
1. In this project, I used Amazon Lightsail for a publicly accessible Ubuntu Linux Server to host the web application. I made an account with Amazon Web Services and created a Lightsail Instance, selecting the "OS only" option and "Ubuntu 16.04 LTS". I kept the instance with its default name. As long as you delete the instance within one month, you should not be charged.
